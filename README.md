Unreel'd is a fully functional from scratch application that I built for the [Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) program by Udacity. 


## Features
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, you will need to put it in the file called "unreeld.properties" the full location is:
    ```
    app/unreeld.properties
    ```
