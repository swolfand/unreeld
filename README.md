Unreel'd is a fully functional from scratch application that I built for the [Android Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801) program by Udacity. 


## Features
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## How to Work with the Source

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to:
    ```
    app/build.gradle
    ```
